## üìñ Summary

This repository contains materials, exercises, and projects from the **"Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python"** course offered by IBM through Coursera as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.

The course provides a comprehensive introduction to using SQL and Python together for data science applications. Students learn to access, retrieve, and manipulate data in relational databases using SQL, and then analyze and visualize that data using Python.

## üéØ Objective

The main objective of this course is to equip students with practical skills for working with databases in data science contexts, enabling them to:

- Write complex SQL queries to extract insights from databases
- Integrate SQL with Python for data analysis
- Create and manage databases and tables
- Perform advanced data manipulation and aggregation
- Develop data science applications that interact with databases
- Apply database skills to real-world data science problems
